# H1: Should Tero wear a helmet?


### Braiterman et al 2020: Threat Modeling Manifesto

* **Proactive Security**: Threat modeling is a process for identifying security and privacy risks early in the lifecycle so they can be addressed before a breach occurs.
* **The 4 Questions**: The framework focuses on answering: What are we working on? What can go wrong? What are we going to do about it? Did we do a good enough job?
* **Values over Tools**: It prioritizes people and collaborative dialogue over specific software or rigid, check-box processes.
* **Continuous Journey**: Inspired by the Agile Manifesto, it is an iterative process that must be updated as the project and threats grow.
* **My Idea**: In a team setting, these four questions could serve as a "Definition of Done" for any new feature to ensure security is never forgotten during development.

### Shostack 2022: World's Shortest Threat Modeling Course

* **Collaboration**: Effective modeling starts with simple sketches or Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to visualize how data moves.
* **STRIDE Framework**: Shostack uses the STRIDE mnemonic to categorize threats: **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation disclosure, **D**enial of service, and **E**levation of privilege.
* **Handling Threats**: Every identified threat must be addressed with operational controls; it should never be ignored or left unmanaged.
* **Low Barrier**: You don't need to be a security expert to start; a whiteboard and a basic understanding of your system are sufficient.
* **Question**: How can we gamify the STRIDE process to make it more engaging for developers who might see security meetings as a distraction?

### OWASP: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

* **Trust Boundaries**: A critical technical concept marking where data moves from an untrusted zone (the internet) to a trusted system.
* **Decomposition**: Breaking down the application allows teams to understand trust levels and communication patterns before writing code.
* **Risk Ranking**: Risks should be prioritized by evaluating the Likelihood of an attack and the potential Impact (Likelihood x Impact).
* **Cloud Security**: Modern models must account for the "Shared Responsibility" model, knowing what is secured by the provider versus the customer.
* **Idea**: For a startup with limited resources, focusing almost entirely on securing "Trust Boundaries" provides the highest security return on investment.

### Darknet Diaries — Ep 117: Mariposa (Daniel Kelley Story)

* **The Story**: Follows Daniel Kelley, a teen who turned to malicious hacking after being targeted himself and then ignored by companies he tried to help ethically.
* **The Slip-up**: Despite his technical skill, he was caught due to simple mistakes: failing to use Tor/VPN for one hack and reusing a Bitcoin address for an extortion attempt.
* **Redemption**: While on bail for four years, he reported over 5,000 vulnerabilities to major organizations like GCHQ and the UN to mitigate his sentence.
* **My Idea**: It is interesting to see human nature here; if people do not feel valued for their positive contributions, they can easily turn toward negative behaviors.
* **My Question**: If those Fortune 500 companies had simply responded with a "Thank You" early on, could they have saved $70 million in future damages?

## a) Security hygiene

These basic practices act as a "helmet" for everyone, reducing risk before a full threat model is even needed:

* **Password Management**: Use unique, long, and random passwords for every account to prevent credential stuffing.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enable MFA on all critical accounts, prioritizing authentication apps over SMS.
* **Automatic Updates**: Ensure all operating systems, browsers, and applications are set to auto-update to patch vulnerabilities immediately.
* **Encryption**: Use full-disk encryption like BitLocker or FileVault to protect data if hardware is lost or stolen.
* **The 3-2-1 Backup Rule**: Maintain 3 copies of data, on 2 media types, with 1 copy kept offline or off-site.
* **Least Privilege**: In companies, ensure employees only have access to the specific data required for their job.

## b) Make-belief boogie-man: ShareMyRide Threat Model

**The Company**: *ShareMyRide* is a ride-sharing service for university students.

### (1) What are we working on?

* 
**Assets**: Student school credentials, real-time GPS locations, and payment processing tokens.


* 
**Prioritization**: Student safety and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) are the "crown jewels".


* 
**System Diagram**: Mobile App (iOS/Android)  Cloud API  Student Database.


* 
**Touchpoints**: Users log in with school credentials to find rides; payments are split and processed automatically within the app.



### (2) What can go wrong? (Using STRIDE)

* **Spoofing**: An attacker steals school credentials to pretend to be a trusted student driver to gain physical access to passengers.
* 
**Information Disclosure**: A leak in the database exposes student home addresses and frequent travel patterns.


* 
**Denial of Service**: An attacker floods the API, crashing the app during a busy commute, leaving students stranded and damaging trust.


* **Risk (Expected Value)**: A serious data breach fine of €50,000 with a 10% probability = **€5,000 expected risk value**.

### (3) What are we going to do about it? (Using META)

* **Mitigate**: Use Multi-Factor Authentication and regular security audits to reduce the risk of spoofing and unauthorized access.
* **Eliminate**: Automatically delete GPS logs after a trip is completed to remove the possibility of leaking sensitive movement history.
* **Transfer**: Use a third-party service like Stripe for payments so ShareMyRide never stores actual credit card numbers.
* 
**Accept**: Accept the risk of minor, non-security-related app bugs while focusing all resources on protecting the core user database.



### (4) Did we do a good enough job?

* 
**Audit**: We will undergo annual legal and security assessments to ensure we comply with GDPR and local transportation laws.


* 
**Continuous Testing**: The development team will partner with software experts for regular vulnerability scans and usability testing.
