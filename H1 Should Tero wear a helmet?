## Braiterman et al 2020: Threat Modeling Manifesto

Threat modeling is a proactive way to find security and privacy risks before a system is built or attacked.

The four main questions are:

1. What are we working on?
2. What can go wrong?
3. What are we going to do about it?
4. Did we do a good enough job?

The approach values people and discussion over strict tools and checklists. It is meant to be continuous rather than a one-time activity.

My idea: These four questions could be used as a definition of done for new features in software development.

## Shostack 2022: Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

Threat modeling starts with simple drawings or data flow diagrams to show how information moves in a system.

The STRIDE model is used to identify threats:
Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information disclosure
Denial of service
Elevation of privilege

Every identified threat should be handled in some way and not ignored.

You do not need to be a security expert to start, just a basic understanding of the system.

My question: How could STRIDE be turned into a game to make it more interesting for developers?

## OWASP: Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

Trust boundaries show where data moves from an untrusted area like the internet into a trusted system.

Breaking a system into smaller parts helps teams understand security better before writing code.

Risks should be ranked based on likelihood and impact.

In cloud environments, security follows a shared responsibility model between provider and user.

My idea: A small startup should focus mainly on securing trust boundaries for the best security benefit.

## Darknet Diaries Episode 117: Mariposa

The story follows Daniel Kelley, a teenager who began hacking after being attacked online and ignored by companies he tried to help.

He was caught because of small mistakes, such as not always using Tor or a VPN and reusing a Bitcoin address.

While on bail, he reported more than 5000 vulnerabilities to organizations like GCHQ and the UN.

My idea: People who feel unappreciated may turn from good behavior to bad behavior.

My question: If companies had simply said thank you, could they have avoided millions of dollars in damages?

## b) Security hygiene

These are basic security practices that protect users before full threat modeling is needed.

Password management: Use long and unique passwords for every account.
Multi-factor authentication: Use an authentication app instead of SMS when possible.
Automatic updates: Keep all devices and software up to date.
Encryption: Use full disk encryption on laptops and phones.
3-2-1 backup rule: Three copies of data, on two types of media, with one copy off-site.
Least privilege: Users should only have access to what they need for their work.

## c) ShareMyRide Threat Model

ShareMyRide is a ride-sharing service for university students.

### 1) What are we working on?

Assets:
Student school credentials
Real-time GPS locations
Payment processing data

Priorities:
Student safety
Personally identifiable information

System overview:
Mobile app to cloud API to student database

Users log in with school credentials, find rides, and split payments inside the app.

---

### 2) What can go wrong?

Spoofing: An attacker steals credentials and pretends to be a student driver.

Information disclosure: A data leak exposes student home addresses and travel patterns.

Denial of service: An attacker overloads the system and crashes the app during busy hours.

Risk calculation:
Possible fine 50000 euros
Probability 10 percent
Expected risk 5000 euros

---

### 3) What are we going to do about it?

Mitigate:
Use multi-factor authentication
Conduct regular security audits

Eliminate:
Delete GPS data automatically after each trip

Transfer:
Use Stripe for payments so ShareMyRide does not store credit card data

Accept:
Allow minor non-security bugs while protecting the main database

---

### 4) Did we do a good enough job?

Audit:
Annual security and legal reviews to follow GDPR rules

Continuous testing:
Regular vulnerability scans and usability testing
