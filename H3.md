## Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on VirtualBox

### A Sandbox for Learning
A **Virtual Machine** is like a safe sandbox inside your computer. You can practice hacking and changing settings here, and if you break something, your actual computer stays perfectly safe.

### Setting It Up Right
When setting up the virtual computer, it's best to give it enough "brain power" (RAM) so it doesn't feel laggy. The guide recommends around **2000MB to 4000MB**.

### The "Live" Feature
You can run Linux from a digital "CD" (the ISO file) to try it out before you actually save it onto the virtual hard drive.

### Final Polish
After installing, you need to run a few updates to make sure the system is secure and install **Guest Additions** to make the window bigger and easier to use.

### My Question
**Is there a way to "undo" a mistake in the virtual machine if I delete a file I shouldn't have?**

Yes. You can use **snapshots** in VirtualBox. A snapshot saves the current state of the virtual machine. If something goes wrong, you can return to that snapshot and undo the mistake.

## Karvinen 2020: Command Line Basics Revisited

### Talking to the Computer
Instead of clicking icons, the **Command Line** lets you talk to the computer by typing instructions.

### Finding Your Way
Commands like `pwd` tell you exactly where you are in the computer's folders, and `ls` shows you what is in the room with you.

### No Safety Net
Unlike Windows or Mac, when you delete a file using the command line (`rm`), it doesn't go to a "Trash Can"—it is gone forever, so you have to be careful.

### Learning the Language
Most commands come with a "manual" you can read by typing `man` followed by the command name.

### My Question
**Which command is the most important one for a beginner to memorize first?**

## A) Disabling Networking and Testing Connectivity in Linux

The Scan: I used Nmap to scan my own computer (localhost) to check for open ports.

The Doors: The scan checked 1,000 common ports and found that 999 of them were closed, which is good for security.

The One Open Door: Port 631 was open. This port is used for printing services (CUPS), which is normal on a new Linux system.

Conclusion: My computer is currently very secure because almost all ports are closed and no unnecessary services are running.

## C) Daemon scan
