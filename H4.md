## OWASP "Big Four" Vulnerabilities

### 1. Broken Access Control
This happens when a user can access parts of a system they are not supposed to, such as a normal user viewing an **Admin** panel.

**Analogy:**  
Like a hotel where your room key opens *every* door in the building.

---

### 2. Security Misconfiguration
Occurs when systems are left with unsafe default settings, such as using weak passwords like `password123` or exposing unnecessary features.

**Analogy:**  
The digital equivalent of leaving your front door unlocked.

---

### 3. Vulnerable Components
Using outdated or unsupported libraries, frameworks, or code that contain known security flaws.

**Analogy:**  
Building a house with wood that’s already rotting.

---

### 4. Injection
An attacker tricks an application into executing unintended commands by inserting code into input fields (e.g. SQL Injection).

**Analogy:**  
Writing “give me all your money” on a check instead of your name — and the bank actually doing it.

---

### xkcd 327 – *Little Bobby Tables*
A famous comic showing how a poorly protected system breaks when a child’s name contains malicious code, accidentally deleting a school database.

**Why it matters:**  
It humorously demonstrates how injection attacks happen when user input is not properly handled.
