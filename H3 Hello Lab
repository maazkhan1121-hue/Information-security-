Karvinen 2021: Install Debian on Virtualbox
A Sandbox for Learning: A "Virtual Machine" is like a safe sandbox inside your computer. You can practice hacking and changing settings here, and if you break something, your actual computer stays perfectly safe.

Setting it Up Right: When setting up the virtual computer, it's best to give it enough "brain power" (RAM) so it doesn't feel laggy. The guide recommends around 2000MB to 4000MB.

The "Live" Feature: You can run Linux from a digital "CD" (the ISO file) to try it out before you actually save it onto the virtual hard drive.

Final Polish: After installing, you need to run a few updates to make sure the system is secure and "Guest Additions" to make the window bigger and easier to use.

My Question: Is there a way to "undo" a mistake in the virtual machine if I delete a file I shouldn't have, because unlike windows for example their "safety net".

Talking to the Computer: Instead of clicking icons, the "Command Line" lets you talk to the computer by typing instructions.

Finding Your Way: Commands like pwd tell you exactly where you are standing in the computer's folders, and ls shows you what is in the room with you.

No Safety Net: Unlike Windows or Mac, when you delete a file using the command line (rm), it doesn't go to a "Trash Can"—it is gone forever, so you have to be careful.

Learning the Language: Most commands come with a "manual" you can read by typing man followed by the command name.

My Question: Which command is the most important one for a beginner to memorize first or is that something subjective?
